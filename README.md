BUIDL Submission: Edubuk – Bridging the Gap Between Education and Employment
1. Introduction
The current education system is failing to keep up with the rapid advancements in technology. Many graduates and professionals lack the practical, industry-relevant skills required to secure high-paying tech jobs. At the same time, the rise in fake degrees and unverifiable credentials is making it difficult for employers to trust candidates’ qualifications.

Edubuk is a next-generation AI-powered, blockchain-based platform designed to bridge this gap. It provides no-code/low-code learning programs in emerging technologies and offers blockchain-backed digital credentials, ensuring transparency, security, and trust in academic and professional qualifications.

2. Problem Statement
Edubuk addresses two major challenges in education and employment:

1. Lack of Industry-Relevant Skills
Many graduates and professionals lack hands-on experience in high-demand fields like AI, Blockchain, Cybersecurity, and Cloud Computing.

Traditional education systems focus on theory rather than practical skills, making it hard for learners to secure jobs.

Edubuk provides structured, no-code/low-code learning programs that enable learners from all backgrounds to gain job-ready skills without extensive coding experience.

2. Lack of Trust in Academic and Work Credentials
Fake degrees and certificates are increasing, making credential verification a major challenge for employers and institutions.

Current verification methods are slow, expensive, and prone to fraud.

Edubuk uses Blockchain technology to create tamper-proof digital credentials, allowing instant and verifiable education and work experience records.

By solving these two challenges, Edubuk empowers individuals with in-demand tech skills while ensuring secure, blockchain-backed verification of their qualifications, making them job-ready and globally credible.
